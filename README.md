# Graph
BU MET CS341 Final #2

1.	 The program Graph5D1D.cpp, shown below, is a reduced version of the Graph5D1B.cpp program which we last worked with in class.  From my point of view, this version of the program is still hard to use because all of the data has to be entered before the user receives its displays.  Please modify this program so that the user can enter several edges, select the displays to view, then enter more edges, delete one or more edges select displays to view and get Help until s\he decides to exit from the program.  This means that I want the main of the program revised to include a menu.  The top of the main will still ask the user to enter the number of vertices, and this number will remain fixed throughout the run as it is now.  Then the user will see a menu which allows her\him to do the following operations: 
1. Enter an edge into the Adjacency Matrix, 
2. Delete an edge from the Adjacency Matrix, 
3. Display the Adjacency Matrix (Please fix the horizontal title to produce only the number of columns entered initially by the user.), 
4. Display the Directed List of Neighbor Vertexes for a specified vertex, 
5. Display the Depth-first Traversal through the Graph, starting with a specified vertex, 
6. Get brief Help with the Menu,
7. Exit from the program.
